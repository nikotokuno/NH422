__Hasnain Mazhar__ -> Hyponymy and Inconsistent Identifiers  

## Deliverable Report ##  

Each team member performed equal amounts of work during the development cycle. The team started by meeting to discuss the project and clarify any confusing parts with one another. At this meeting, we also discussed how to split the required work, assigned metrics for each member to implement, familiarize ourselves with the source control we selected to use and formed a plan for the days leading to the deliverable due date. Niko created the base project and uploaded it to the Git repository in which other team members created new branches to implement their assigned checks in. Each member actively worked on their checks, following TDD principles to simplify the coding process. Team members committed locally, often, and push to their branches upon the completion of a small feature of each check. After the code for the checks were complete and all unit test cases passed, each team member performed integration testing to ensure that their checks would work with other objects/components/modules. At this point, the team met with the TA to clarify how to get the custom checks to work when running the solution in a new Eclipse app. The TA also helped the team with how to perform integration tests for the checks created. After the integration tests were complete, each team member tested the performance of their checks and optimized their solutions to provide the quickest results. Lastly, each team member performed acceptance tests based upon their research of what each metric should and should not do for their assigned checks.
